# Full Stack API Final Project


## Full Stack Trivia

Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out.

That's where you come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch. The application must:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.


## Getting Started
### Pre-requisites and Local Development
Developers using this project should already have Python3, pip and node installed on their local machines.
#### Backend
From the backend folder run pip install requirements.txt. All required packages are included in the requirements file.

To run the application run the following commands:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```

These commands put the application in development and directs our application to use the __init__.py file in our flaskr folder. Working in development mode shows an interactive debugger in the console and restarts the server whenever changes are made. If running locally on Windows, look for the commands in the Flask documentation.

The application is run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ by default and is a proxy in the frontend configuration.

The [./backend](https://github.com/udacity/FSND/blob/master/projects/02_trivia_api/starter/backend/README.md) directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. 


#### Frontend
From the frontend folder, run the following commands to start the client:
```bash
npm install // only once to install dependencies
npm start 
```
By default, the frontend will run on localhost:3000.




The [./frontend](https://github.com/udacity/FSND/blob/master/projects/02_trivia_api/starter/frontend/README.md) directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. 


#### Test
To run the tests, run
```bash
dropdb trivia_test
createdb trivia_test
psql trivia_test < trivia.psql
python test_flaskr.py
```
The first time you run the tests, omit the dropdb command.



## API Reference
### Getting Started
* Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, ` http://127.0.0.1:5000/ `, which is set as a proxy in the frontend configuration
* Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys.

### Error Handling
Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:
```bash
{
    "success": False, 
    "error": 400,
    "message": "bad request"
}

```
The API will return three error types when requests fail:
* 400: Bad Request
* 404: Resource Not Found
* 422: Not Processable

### Endpoints
